Thank you! This has been fixed. 🙂

@OneTrueKirk Will FEI be the only token that is used to mint VOLT or are there plans to add this functionality for other stables?


[04/05/2022 9:51 PM] elliot#8872
There could be other stables added, however, USDT will definitely not be added

why not USDT? just curious.


[04/05/2022 10:38 PM] elliot#8872
it's the sketchiest of all centralized stablecoins, it always has FUD and they hold debt in chinese real estate development firms which is a very suspect sector because of the recent defaults.

Elaborating on this topic, it is likely that other stablecoins will be onboarded in the future. Any stablecoin that is verifiably fully backed or overcollateralized and offers access to an attractive DeFi yield source could be a candidate, the most notable examples would be DAI and USDC which are more widely integrated in DeFi than FEI today.

VOLT will not be mintable against undercollateralized stablecoins or those with risky or unverifiable backing like USDT.
